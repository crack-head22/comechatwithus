## Chatbot Integration with Voiceflow

The chatbot on this website is powered by **Voiceflow**, which integrates **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** models to provide intelligent and context-aware responses. Here's how the chatbot operates:

### How Voiceflow Uses NLP Models

1. **Intent Recognition**  
   The chatbot uses NLP models to identify the user's intent behind each query. By analyzing the sentence structure, keywords, and context, it determines what the user is asking for.  
   - Example:  
     **User Query**: "How do I create a source in Zeotap?"  
     **Recognized Intent**: "Setting up a data source."

2. **Entity Extraction**  
   NLP models extract key details or entities (e.g., tools, configurations, or actions) mentioned in the query.  
   - Example:  
     **User Query**: "Integrate Zeotap with Google Analytics."  
     **Extracted Entities**: "Zeotap," "Google Analytics," "integration."

3. **Query Optimization**  
   The NLP system processes long or complex queries as a whole, without breaking them down unnecessarily, ensuring users receive precise and actionable responses.  
   - Example:  
     **User Query**: "Guide me through setting up a new source in Zeotap and integrating it with Google Analytics."  
     **Chatbot Response**: Consolidated steps for both setting up a source and performing the integration.

4. **Bilingual Responses**  
   The chatbot can respond in multiple languages, depending on the language of the query.  
   - Example:  
     **User Query in Spanish**: "¿Cómo puedo integrar Zeotap con Google Analytics?"  
     **Chatbot Response in Spanish**: "Para integrar Zeotap con Google Analytics, sigue estos pasos: ..."

## How the Chatbot Provides Accurate Answers

The chatbot's responses are rooted in the **official documentation** and knowledge base provided by Zeotap. This ensures that users receive accurate and reliable information every time they ask a question.

1. **Knowledge Base-Driven Answers**  
   - The chatbot pulls directly from the knowledge base and documentation to formulate its responses.  
   - Example:  
     **User Query**: "What are the steps to create a new audience in Zeotap?"  
     **Chatbot Response**: Provides step-by-step instructions derived from the official guide.

2. **Document Parsing**  
   - The chatbot navigates the documentation dynamically to identify and extract relevant information.  
   - Example:  
     If a user asks about integrations, the chatbot searches through the integration documentation to deliver precise steps.

3. **No Guesswork**  
   - Unlike general-purpose chatbots, this assistant avoids providing speculative answers. It either delivers verified information or acknowledges if the required details are unavailable.

---

## Cross-CDP Comparison Handling

The chatbot is equipped to handle **cross-CDP comparison queries**. This allows users to understand how Zeotap compares to other platforms like Segment, mParticle, or Lytics.

- Example:  
  **User Query**: "How does Zeotap's audience creation compare to Lytics?"  
  **Chatbot Response**:  
  "Zeotap provides a simplified audience creation workflow focused on centralized data, while Lytics emphasizes behavioral data segmentation. Zeotap also offers more advanced integrations for consent management."

- Advanced Comparisons:  
  If the query involves technical aspects, the chatbot dynamically pulls relevant details from documentation for both platforms and provides a detailed analysis.
